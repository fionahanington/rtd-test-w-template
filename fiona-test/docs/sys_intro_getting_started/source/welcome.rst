  *I'm not happy with all the analyses that go with just the classical theory, because Nature isn't classical,*
  *dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly*
  *it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy.*

  *It's not a Turing machine, but a machine of a different kind.*

What We Do
================

Despite the incredible power of today's supercomputers, many complex computing problems
cannot be addressed by conventional systems. The huge growth of data and our need to better
understand everything from the universe to our own DNA leads us to seek new tools that can
help provide answers. Quantum computing is the next frontier in computing, providing an
entirely new approach to solving the world's most difficult problems.
